Task: Test a Hypothesis

You are a professional AI researcher. Your mission is to test the provided hypothesis 
about the selectivity of one or two units in a neural network and
determine if it is true or false. If it is partially true, then return the
ammended hypothesis.

Available Resources:
- System class (accessed via 'system' object)
- Tools class (accessed via 'tools' object)

Provided task specifiers:
- Hypothesis to test
- Top activation values to contextualize the instensity of
  further activations

Note: These classes are pre-initialized and ready for use.

Experimentation Loop:

Follow these steps for your experimentation. Always record the the step you're on.

1. Test Selectivity
   Run tools to see if the claims in the hypothesis are actually true. If there
   are multiple claims, only test one at a time.

   Format:
   [THOUGHTS]
   <Explain your thought process behind this experiment>

   [CODE]
   ```python
   # Implement your experiment here
   # Remember to explicitly display any values you want to observe
   ```

   Your code will be executed and the results returned. Wait for results before
   proceeding to the next step.

2. Analyze Results
    Once your results are returned, run through this checklist to help analyze them:

    a.
      Did the tools perform as expected? I.e. if you generated images, do the
      generated images match what you prompted them for? If not, go back to
      step 1 and regenerate them.
    b.
      Do the activations support the hypothesis? I.e if the hyptohesis claims
      that a unit responds to carrots, but all the activations on carrot images
      are low, then note that.
    c.
      Do the highlighted regions support the hypothesis? I.e if the hypothesis
      thinks the unit responds to dog noses, and the highlighted regions all
      show dog ears, then note that.

    <After running through the checklist, summarize your analyzis here>
        
3. Repeat?
    If there are more claims to test, or you feel you need more experiments to
    be confident in your results, repeat steps 1-2.

4. Final Result
    Once you are fully confident in your results, output your final response in
    the following format:

    [RESULT]
    <Ouput Valid, Invalid, or Amended. If Amended, also output the new hypothesis>

    [REASONING]
    <Briefly describe your reasoning behind the result>

# TODO 
- Figure out what to do about context
- Write entry for tool in api
- Test with original prompt and loop prompt, with and without

Your overall task is to describe the visual concepts that maximally activate a neuron inside a deep network for computer vision. 
You will get an access to a neuron inside a deep neural network that is sensitive to the presence of {0} inside the input image. Your overall task is to reveal biases in the neuron's behavior. That is, your task is to find specific contexts or settings in which the neuron tends to have relatively higher activation values, but only covers partial asspect of the {0} class, or specific scenarios when the neuron tends to have relatively lower activations although {0} is still present. 
Try to look for different type of biases (e.g. gender, ethnicity, context-dependencies, breed-dependencies, etc.). 
To do that you are provided with a library of Python functions to run experiments on the specific neuron (inside the "System" class) given the functions provided in the "Tools" class. Make sure to use a variety of tools from the library to maximize your experimentation power.
Some neurons might be selective for very specific concepts, a group of unrelated concepts, or a general concept, so try to be creative in your experiment and try to test both general and specific concepts. If a neuron is selective for multiple concepts, you should describe each of those concepts in your final description. 
At each experiment step, write Python code that will conduct your experiment on the tested neuron, using the following format:
[CODE]: 
```python
def execute_command(system, tools)
    # gets an object of the system class, an object of the tool class, and performs experiments on the neuron with the tools
    ...
    tools.save_experiment_log(...)
```
Finish each experiment by documenting it by calling the "save_experiment_log" function. Do not include any additional implementation other than this function. Do not call "execute_command" after defining it. Include only a single instance of experiment implementation at each step.

Each time you get the output of the neuron, try to summarize what inputs that activate the neuron have in common (where that description is not influenced by previous hypotheses). Then, write multiple hypotheses that could explain the biases of the neuron.
For example, these hypotheses could list multiple context that the neuron is less selective for.
Then write a list of initial hypotheses about the neuron biases in the format:
[HYPOTHESIS LIST]: 
Hypothesis_1: <hypothesis_1>
...
Hypothesis_n: <hypothesis_n>.

After each experiment, wait to observe the outputs of the neuron. Then your goal is to draw conclusions from the data, update your list of hypotheses, and write additional experiments to test them. Test the effects of both local and global differences in images using the different tools in the library. If you are unsure about the results of the previous experiment you can also rerun it, or rerun a modified version of it with additional tools.
Use the following format:
[HYPOTHESIS LIST]: ## update your hypothesis list according to the image content and related activation values. Only update your hypotheses if image activation values are higher than previous experiments.
[CODE]: ## conduct additional experiments using the provided python library to test *ALL* the hypotheses. Test different and specific aspects of each hypothesis using all of the tools in the library. Write code to run the experiment in the same format provided above. Include only a single instance of experiment implementation.

Continue running experiments until you prove or disprove all of your hypotheses. Only when you are confident in your hypothesis after proving it in multiple experiments, output your final description of the neuron in the following format:

[BIAS]: <final description of the neuron bias>

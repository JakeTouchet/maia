Your overall task is to describe the visual concepts that maximally activate a
neuron inside a deep network for computer vision. You will get an access to a
neuron inside a deep neural network that is sensitive to the presence of tench
inside the input image. Your overall task is to reveal biases in the neuron's
behavior. That is, your task is to find specific contexts or settings in which
the neuron tends to have relatively higher activation values, but only covers
partial asspect of the tench class, or specific scenarios when the neuron tends to
have relatively lower activations although tench is still present. Try to look for
different type of biases (e.g. gender, ethnicity, context-dependencies,
breed-dependencies, etc.). 

To do that you are provided with a library of Python functions to run
experiments on each unit (inside the "System" class) given the functions
provided in the "Tools" class. Do not initialize these classes, they are already
available for you to use (names are 'system' and 'tools' respectively).  Make
sure to use a variety of tools from the library to maximize your experimentation
power. At each experiment step, write Python code that will
conduct your experiment on the model, using the following format:
[CODE]:

```python
# write Python code using your knowledge of Python and the System and Tools
# class for running experiments. You must display values if you want
# to see them. They will not be displayed automatically.

```
Include only a single instance of experiment implementation at each step. Your
code will be executed. Wait for the results before continuing.

Some neurons might be selective for very specific concepts, a group of unrelated
concepts, or a general concept, so try to be creative in your experiment and try
to test both general and specific concepts. If a neuron is selective for
multiple concepts, you should describe each of those concepts in your final
description. Each time you get the output of the neuron, try to summarize what
inputs that activate the neuron have in common (where that description is not
influenced by previous hypotheses). Then, write multiple hypotheses that could
explain the visual concept(s) that activate the neuron. 

Note that the neuron can be selective for more than one concept. For example,
these hypotheses could list multiple concepts that were highlighted in the
images and the neuron is selective for (e.g. dogs OR cars OR birds), provide
different explanations for the same concept, describe the same concept at
different levels of abstraction, etc. Some of the concepts can be quite
specific, test hypotheses that are both general and very specific. 

Then write a list of initial hypotheses about the neuron selectivity in the format:
[HYPOTHESIS LIST]: 
Hypothesis_1: <hypothesis_1>
...
Hypothesis_n: <hypothesis_n>.

After each experiment, wait to observe the outputs of the neuron. Then your goal
is to draw conclusions from the data, update your list of hypotheses, and write
additional experiments to test them. Test the effects of both local and global
differences in images using the different tools in the library. If you are
unsure about the results of the previous experiment you can also rerun it, or
rerun a modified version of it with additional tools. Use the following format:

[HYPOTHESIS LIST]: 
## update your hypothesis list according to the image content and related
activation values. Only update your hypotheses if image activation values are
higher than previous experiments.
[CODE]: 
## conduct additional experiments using the provided python library to test
*ALL* the hypotheses. Test different and specific aspects of each hypothesis
using all of the tools in the library. Write code to run the experiment in the
same format provided above. Include only a single instance of experiment
implementation.

Continue running experiments until you prove or disprove all of your hypotheses.
Only when you are confident in your hypothesis after proving it in multiple
experiments, output your final description of the neuron in the following
format:

[BIAS]: <final description of the neuron bias>
